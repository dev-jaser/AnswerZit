# AnswerZit Password Generator - Encrypt/Decryption Tool

## Description
The goal of this project is to develop a secure and intuitive password-generating, encryption, and decryption Python software. It solves the issue of the lack of easily available, trustworthy solutions for creating secure passwords and safeguarding private data. Strong encryption is provided by the application to guarantee data security and secrecy, protecting users' private and business correspondence. By making the process of creating strong, secure passwords easier, automated password generation lowers the possibility of breaches brought on by reused or weak passwords.

The project distinguishes itself by offering a user-friendly interface that enables advanced security features to be accessed by a wide range of people, including non-technical users. To protect user data, it integrates industry best practices in security, including error handling and secure key management. Program dependability and usability are ensured by extensive testing and documentation. In order to provide a comprehensive security solution, the project also plans to incorporate features like a password strength analyzer and safe password management. The ultimate goal of this project is to increase overall digital security by enabling consumers to easily protect their digital assets.

## Key Features
- `Encryption`:  is the process of encoding the data. i.e. converting plain text into ciphertext. This conversion is done with a key called an encryption key.
- `Decryption`:  is the process of decoding the encoded data. Converting the ciphertext into plain text. This process requires a key that we used for encryption.
- `Password Generation`: using a tool that generates a random combination of numbers, letters, and symbols to be used as a password. Password generators let you exclude or include certain characters, allowing you to customize the password complexity to your needs. 
- `Command-Line Interface (CLI) and User Interface (UI)`: is a text-based user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system or software by entering text commands into a terminal or console window.
- `Best Practices for Security`: common examples are hashing, salting etc..
- `Documentation and Testing`

## Non-Functional Requirements
**Performance Requirements**:
- `Encryption/Decryption`: Should complete within 1-2 seconds for files up to 10 MB to ensure quick processing for both personal and business use cases.
- `Password Generation`: The process should be completed within 0.5 seconds to offer an efficient user experience.
- `Throughput`: The application must handle multiple encryption and decryption tasks simultaneously without performance degradation, catering to the needs of IT managers and business owners.

## Future Iterations
In future iterations, `Answerzit` will continue to improve on its core security principles by incorporating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Ensuring our users verify their identity through multiple methods before accessing their encrypted data or passwords can prevent a possible data leak. We have taken more than the necessary precautions to minimize our risk here at `Answerzit`. The software will be developed to support cross-platform compatibility, extending its reach to users on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Additionally, a browser extension may be introduced, enabling seamless password management directly within web browsers for quick and secure online account access. If time and funding allow it, a mobile application will also be created, providing access to encryption, decryption, and password generation features across all devices. Furthermore, user activity monitoring and alerts will be added, offering real-time notifications for any suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts, thereby significantly enhancing overall security awareness. `Answerzit` has a lot of options to branch out and will continue to do so for the betterment of the program and for our users.
